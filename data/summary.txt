<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> is a massive online crowdfunding platform that has enabled inspired creators to make their dreams reality. Since the site launched in 2009, over $6.4 billion USD has been pledged by the site's users (aka backers), which has funded over 215,000 inidividual projects. <br>
<br>
Projects can be almost anything imaginable - from food and entertainment to 3D printing and wearable tech. The most popular projects engage tens of thousands of backers to raise millions in funding. The catch is that a project creator only receives funding if their initial target is met while the project is active (30 days on average). <br>

While more than half of projects are successful there is clearly a significantly likelihood a project will fail. In fact, 17% of projects that fail do so without attracting a single backer. So what's the secret to success?
