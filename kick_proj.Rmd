## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

ks <- read.csv('Kickstarter_Campaigns_DataSet.csv')
head(ks)
class(ks)
summary(ks)
str(ks)



library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

#fix dates and extract m/d/y
ks <- ks %>% mutate(launched_at=mdy_hm(launched_at)) %>%
  mutate(launch_year=year(launched_at)) %>% 
  mutate(launch_month=month(launched_at)) %>%
  mutate(launch_dom=day(launched_at)) %>%
  mutate(launch_dow=wday(launched_at)) %>%
  mutate(deadline=mdy_hm(deadline)) %>% 
  
  






```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
